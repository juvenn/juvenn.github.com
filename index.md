<h1>About</h1>

<section>

<p>I'm Juvenn Woo, I make web software. I walk, and I'm telling stories
here, in the context of China.</p>

<p>I was a programmer at <a
href="http://charls.ccer.edu.cn">CHARLS</a>.</p>

<p>I have been programming on Linux since 2008, and have built web
software in Python, Ruby, and PHP. My most recent interests are getting
into functional programming, mostly in Erlang and Clojure. I am the
maintainer of <a
href="https://github.com/juvenn/mustache.vim">mustache.vim</a>.</p>

<p>I grew up from a bazaar in a small town, beside the Yangtze
River<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Then I majored in Economics at a small college, where I have studied
through Walter Nicholson's <a
href="http://amzn.com/0324421621"><em>Microeconomic Theory</em></a>, and
worked out Walter Rudin's <a
href="http://amzn.com/007054235X"><em>Principles of Mathematical
Analysis</em></a> (aka Baby Rudin), but I got stuck at Chapter 3rd of
Thomas Hungerford's <a
href="http://amzn.com/0387905189"><em>Algebra</em></a>.  Each week I
would ride bycicle for an hour to visit the library at <a
href="http://www.nim.nankai.edu.cn/nim_e/index.htm">Chern Institute of
Mathematics</a>, though I ended up reading stories of mathematicians
rather than studying mathematics there. I taught myself programming with
papers and pencils. And I don't have PhD or Master degrees.</p>

<p>I try to make things simple and beautiful.</p>
