<p>I write rarely, but very thanks for your interest to read.  There are
two ways you could get updated.</p>

<p>The first is by email, a manual but human way. Please write me an
email: <a target="_blank"
href="mailto:machese@gmail.com?subject=Subscribe%20me%20on%20walkingcloud">
Subscribe me on walkingcloud</a>, and I will remember sending you email
when I update.</p>


<p>The other way, you can subscribe the following feed in a feed reader,
which will automatically pull the updates for you. </p>
