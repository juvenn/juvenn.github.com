### Academic

* [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070856133) by Walter Rudin. A.k.a *Baby Rudin*, the 300-pages book is a classic and timeless introduction to real analysis. It is terse, rigorous, yet comprehensive. A must read for anyone interested in rigorous math.
* [The Elements of
Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and et al. A.k.a *ESL*, a comprehensive introduction to statistical learning. It covers topics from regression models, to boosting, to neural networks. (I've not finished it yet) The [open course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning) by the authors is a great ride too.
* [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013409266X) by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron. A.k.a *CSAPP*, low-level computer architecture with background in hardware engineering. It dives into cpu instructions, assembly, memory addressing, and gives a thourough understanding on how computer works.


### Non-fiction

* [Mathematics in Western Culture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/019500714X) by Morris Kline. A history of mathematics, from ancient Greece to modern age. It is the book that got me interested in math.
* [The Rise of the Western World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521290996) by Douglass C. North, the Nobel laureate in 1993. A fresh take on economic history, effecient institutions boost tech revolutions, economic growth and prosperity.
* [新兴古典经济学与超边际分析](https://book.douban.com/subject/1085393/) by Xiaokai Yang, 2003. A novel framework for economic theory, which trys to integrate the institution into the model, instead of leaving it as an external variable. It is not an easy read, but very refreshing.

### Fiction

* [War and Peace]()
* [百年孤独](https://book.douban.com/subject/6082808/). Chinese translation of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, a classic by Gabriel García Márquez.
