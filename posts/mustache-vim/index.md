title: Mustache Vim

Mustache is a functional(?) template engine, written in Ruby by GitHub's [defunkt](http://github.com/defunkt). Put other things aside, I like the name **mustache**, and that's the main reason I looked into the source. Then I found the awesome compile algorithm, the creative approach makes me more enjoyable in working with Mustache.

I like Vim too. So I grabbed [mkd.vim](http://plasticboy.com/markdown-vim-mode/), and created [mustache.vim][1] side by side. It's not evolutionary, but will certainly make you a little enjoyment.

Here you go, [mustache.vim][1].
